v3.0.0 (2020-06-05)
===================

ixmp v3.0.0 coincides with message_ix v3.0.0.

Migration notes
---------------

Excel input/output (I/O)
   The file format used by :meth:`.Scenario.to_excel` and :meth:`.read_excel` is now fully specified; see :doc:`file-io`.

   ixmp writes and reads items with more elements than the ~10⁶ row maximum of the Excel data format, by splitting these across multiple sheets.

   The I/O code now explicitly checks for situations where the index *sets* and *names* for an item are ambiguous; see :ref:`this example <excel-ambiguous-dims>` for how to initialize and read these items.

Updated dependencies
   The minimum versions of the following dependencies are increased:

   - JPype1 0.7.5
   - pandas 1.0
   - dask 2.14 (for reporting)

Deprecations and deprecation policy
   The following items, marked as deprecated in ixmp 2.0, are removed (:pull:`254`):

   - :file:`$HOME/.local/ixmp/` as a configuration location.
     Configuration files are now placed in the standard :file:`$HOME/.local/share/ixmp/`.
   - positional and ``dbtype=`` arguments to :class:`.Platform`/:class:`.JDBCBackend`.
   - ``first_model_year=``, ``keep_sol=``, and ``scen=`` arguments to :meth:`~.Scenario.clone`.
     Use `shift_first_model_year`, `keep_solution`, and `scenario`, respectively.
   - ``rixmp.legacy``, an earlier version of :ref:`the R interface <rixmp>` that did not use reticulate.

   Newly deprecated is:

   - `cache` keyword argument to :class:`.Scenario`.
     Caching is controlled at the :class:`.Platform`/Backend level, using the same keyword argument.

   Starting with ixmp v3.0, arguments and other features marked as deprecated will follow a standard deprecation policy: they will be removed no sooner than the second major release following the release in which they are marked deprecated.
   For instance, a feature marked deprecated in ixmp version "10.5" would be retained in ixmp versions "11.x", and removed only in version "12.0" or later.

v2.0.0 (2020-01-14)
===================

ixmp v2.0.0 coincides with message_ix v2.0.0.

Migration notes
---------------

Support for **Python 2.7 is dropped** as it has reached end-of-life, meaning no further releases will be made even to fix bugs.
See `PEP-0373 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/>`_ and https://python3statement.org.
``ixmp`` users must upgrade to Python 3.

**Configuration** for ixmp and its storage backends has been streamlined.
See the ref:`Configuration` section of the documentation for complete details on how to use ``ixmp platform add`` register local and remote databases.
To migrate from pre-2.0 settings:

DB_CONFIG_PATH
   …pointed to a directory containing database properties (.properties) files.

   - All Platform configuration is stored in one ixmp configuration file, config.json, and manipulated using the ``ixmp platform`` command and subcommands.
   - The :class:`.Platform` constructor accepts the name of a stored platform configuration.
   - Different storage backends may accept relative or absolute paths to backend-specific configuration files.

DEFAULT_DBPROPS_FILE
   …gave a default backend via a file path.

   - On the command line, use ``ixmp platform add default NAME`` to set ``NAME`` as the default platform.
   - This platform is loaded when ``ixmp.Platform()`` is called without any arguments.

DEFAULT_LOCAL_DB_PATH
   …pointed to a default *local* database.

   - :obj:`.ixmp.config` always contains a platform named 'local' that is located below the configuration path, in the directory 'localdb/default'.
   - To change the location for this platform, use e.g.: ``ixmp platform add local jdbc hsqldb PATH``.

- :pull:`165`: Add support for handling geodata.
- :pull:`232`: Fix exposing whole config file to log output.

v0.2.0 (2019-06-25)
===================

ixmp 0.2.0 provides full support for :meth:`~.Scenario.clone` across platforms (database instances), e.g. from a remote database to a local HSQL database.
IAMC-style timeseries data is better supported, and can be used to store processed results, together with model variables and equations.

Other improvements include a new, dedicated :mod:`.ixmp.testing` module, and user-supplied callbacks in :meth:`.solve`.
The ``retixmp`` package using reticulate to access the ixmp API is renamed to ``rixmp`` and now has its own unit tests (the former ``rixmp`` package can be accessed as ``rixmp.legacy``).

Release 0.2.0 coincides with MESSAGEix release 1.2.0.
