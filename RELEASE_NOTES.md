# Next Release

- [#177](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/pull/177): add ability to pass `gams_args` through `Scenario.solve()`
- [#175](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/pull/175): Drop support for Python 2.
- [#174](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/pull/174): Set `convertStrings=True` for JPype >= 0.7; see the [JPype changelog](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CHANGELOG.html).
- [#173](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/pull/173): Make AppVeyor CI more robust; support pandas 0.25.0.

# v0.2.0

Release 0.2.0 provides full support for Scenario.clone() across platforms (database instances), e.g. from a remote database to a local HSQL database.
IAMC-style timeseries data is better supported, and can be used to store processed results, together with model variables and equations.

Other improvements include a new, dedicated `ixmp.testing` module, user-supplied
callbacks in Scenario.solve(). The `retixmp` package using reticulate to access
the ixmp API is renamed to `rixmp` and now has its own unit tests (the former
`rixmp` package can be accessed as `rixmp.legacy`).

Release 0.2.0 coincides with MESSAGEix release 1.2.0.
