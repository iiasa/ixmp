Contributor License Agreement
=============================

Summary and scope
-----------------

It may seem self-evident that contributing to a project
distributed under an open-source license
is an implicit permission to anyone for using the contributed code.
However, a formal Contributor License Agreements (CLA) 
makes contribution terms explicit and provides the project maintainers 
a record of your agreement to those terms.

A wide range of terms exist in other CLAs,
including choice of law provision, waiver of moral rights, 
consequential damages waiver, as-is disclaimer, etc.
For this project, we follow the more bare-boned GitHub CLA,
which focuses on the three most important clauses:
copyright, patent, and source of contribution.

In short, by signing this Contributor License Agreement, you confirm that:

1. Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever.

2. Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else's rights.


Definition of terms
-------------------

The following terms are used throughout this agreement:

 - **You** - the person or legal entity including its affiliates asked
   to accept this agreement. An affiliate is any entity that controls 
   or is controlled by the legal entity, or is under common control with it.
 - **Project** - the repositories ``message_ix`` and ``ixmp``, and 
   any derived repositories, projects, or software/code packages.
 - **Contribution** - any type of work that is submitted to a Project,
   including any modifications or additions to existing work.
 - **Submitted** - conveyed to a Project via a pull request, commit, issue,
   or any form of electronic, written, or verbal communication with GitHub,
   contributors or maintainers.

1. Grant of Copyright License
-----------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to
the Projects’ maintainers, contributors and users a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute Your contributions and such derivative works. 
Except for this license, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in 
your contributions.

2. Grant of Patent License
--------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to
the Projects’ maintainers, contributors and users a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 
this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily
infringed by your contribution or by combination of your contribution
with the project to which this contribution was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation - including cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit - against You alleging that your contribution or
any project it was submitted to constitutes or is responsible for direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity
under this agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

3. Source of Contribution
-------------------------

Your contribution is either your original creation, based upon previous work
that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
source license and you have the right under that license to submit that work
with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, or you have
clearly identified the source of the contribution and any license or other
restriction (like related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) 
of which you are personally aware.
