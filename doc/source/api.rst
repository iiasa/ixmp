=============

The `ixmp` has application programming interfaces (API) for efficient scientific workflows and data processing.

.. _rixmp:

R (``rixmp`` package)
---------------------

An R interface to the `ixmp` is provided by the ``rixmp`` package.
``rixmp`` uses the `reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>`_ R-to-Python adapter to provide all the features of the :mod:`ixmp` *Python* package::

    # Load the rixmp package
    library(rixmp)

    # An 'ixmp' object is added to the global namespace.
    # It can be used in the same way as the Python ixmp package.
    mp <- ixmp$Platform(dbtype = 'HSQLDB')
    scen <- ixmp$Scenario(mp, 'model name', 'scenario name', version = 'new')

    # etc.

One additional method, ``adapt_to_ret()`` is provided. Access its documentation with::

    ?rixmp::adapt_to_ret

.. warning::
   The *ixmp* source also contains an older R package, now called ``rixmp.legacy`` that provided reduced-functionality versions of :class:`ixmp.Platform` and :class:`ixmp.Scenario`.
   This code is unmaintained and untested, and users are strongly advised to use or migrate to ``rixmp``.

Major syntax differences between ``rixmp.legacy`` and the new ``rixmp`` (see tutorial for practical examples):

Initialization:

``rixmp.legacy``::

    library("rixmp.legacy")
    # launch the ix modeling platform using a local HSQL database instance
    mp <- ixmp.Platform(dbtype="HSQLDB")

``rixmp``::

    library("rixmp")
    ixmp <- import('ixmp')
    mp <- ixmp$Platform(dbtype="HSQLDB")

To load sets and parameter on the oracle database with ``rixmp.legacy`` the user need to load each data entry indipendently::

    scen$init_set("i")
    scen$add_set("i", "seattle")
    scen$add_set("i", "san-diego")

With ``rixmp`` the user can load entire sets of strings or dataframes, which require the additional function 'adapt_to_ret()'::

    scen$init_set("i")
    i.set = c("seattle","san-diego")
    scen$add_set("i", i.set )
    # load dataframes
    scen$init_par("a", c("i"))
    a.df = data.frame( i = i.set, value = c(350 , 600) , unit = 'cases')
    scen$add_par("a", adapt_to_ret(a.df))


.. _gams-api:

GAMS
----

The *ixmp* :doc:`tutorials <tutorials>` use a common example problem from
Dantzig :cite:`dantzig-1963`, implemented in GAMS and available
`from the GAMS website <https://www.gams.com/mccarl/trnsport.gms>`_.
The file ``tutorial/transport/transport_ixmp.gms`` illustrates how such an
existing GAMS model can be simply adapted to work with the |ixmp|.

The steps are:

1. The GAMS definitions of sets ``i`` and ``j``, and parameters ``a``, ``b``,
   ``d``, and ``f``, are modified to **remove explicit values**.
2. The following lines are added **before** the model definition and solution::

    $if not set in  $setglobal in  'ix_transport_data.gdx'
    $if not set out $setglobal out 'ix_transport_results.gdx'

    $gdxin '%in%'
    $load i, j, a, b, d, f
    $gdxin

3. The following line is added **after** the model's ``solve ...;`` statement::

    execute_unload '%out%';

*ixmp* uses GAMS command-line options to pass the values of the compile-time
variables ``in`` and ``out``. This causes the model to read its input data from
a GDX-format file created by *ixmp*, and write its output data to a GDX file
specified by *ixmp*. *ixmp* then automatically retrieves the model solution and
other information from the output file, updating the :class:`ixmp.Scenario` and
database.


Java
----

The `ixmp` is powered by a Java interface to connect a database instance with
the scientific programming interfaces.
