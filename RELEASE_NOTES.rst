v2.0.0 (2020-01-14)
===================

ixmp v2.0.0 coincides with message_ix v2.0.0.

Migration notes
---------------

Support for **Python 2.7 is dropped** as it has reached end-of-life, meaning no further releases will be made even to fix bugs.
See `PEP-0373 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/>`_ and https://python3statement.org.
``ixmp`` users must upgrade to Python 3.

**Configuration** for ixmp and its storage backends has been streamlined.
See the ref:`Configuration` section of the documentation for complete details on how to use ``ixmp platform add`` register local and remote databases.
To migrate from pre-2.0 settings:

DB_CONFIG_PATH
   …pointed to a directory containing database properties (.properties) files.

   - All Platform configuration is stored in one ixmp configuration file, config.json, and manipulated using the ``ixmp platform`` command and subcommands.
   - The :class:`.Platform` constructor accepts the name of a stored platform configuration.
   - Different storage backends may accept relative or absolute paths to backend-specific configuration files.

DEFAULT_DBPROPS_FILE
   …gave a default backend via a file path.

   - On the command line, use ``ixmp platform add default NAME`` to set ``NAME`` as the default platform.
   - This platform is loaded when ``ixmp.Platform()`` is called without any arguments.

DEFAULT_LOCAL_DB_PATH
   …pointed to a default *local* database.

   - :obj:`.ixmp.config` always contains a platform named 'local' that is located below the configuration path, in the directory 'localdb/default'.
   - To change the location for this platform, use e.g.: ``ixmp platform add local jdbc hsqldb PATH``.

v0.2.0 (2019-06-25)
===================

ixmp 0.2.0 provides full support for :meth:`~.Scenario.clone` across platforms (database instances), e.g. from a remote database to a local HSQL database.
IAMC-style timeseries data is better supported, and can be used to store processed results, together with model variables and equations.

Other improvements include a new, dedicated :mod:`.ixmp.testing` module, and user-supplied callbacks in :meth:`.solve`.
The ``retixmp`` package using reticulate to access the ixmp API is renamed to ``rixmp`` and now has its own unit tests (the former ``rixmp`` package can be accessed as ``rixmp.legacy``).

Release 0.2.0 coincides with MESSAGEix release 1.2.0.
