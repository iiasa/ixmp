# Next Release


## Migration notes

Configuration for ixmp and its storage backends has been streamlined.

- Instead of ``DB_CONFIG_PATH``:
  - Platform configuration is stored in the ``config.json`` configuration file.
  - The :class:`Platform` constructor accepts the name of a stored platform configuration.
  - Different storage backends may accept relative or absolute paths to backend-specific configuration files.
- Instead of ``DEFAULT_DBPROPS_FILE``:
  - On the command-line, use ``ixmp platform add NAME ARGS`` followed by ``ixmp platform add default NAME``.
- Instead of ``DEFAULT_LOCAL_DB_PATH``: :obj:`ixmp.config` always contains a platform named 'local' that is located below the configuration path, in the directory 'localdb/default'.
  - To change this path, use, e.g.: ``ixmp platform add local jdbc hsqldb PATH``.

# v0.2.0

Release 0.2.0 provides full support for Scenario.clone() across platforms (database instances), e.g. from a remote database to a local HSQL database.
IAMC-style timeseries data is better supported, and can be used to store processed results, together with model variables and equations.

Other improvements include a new, dedicated `ixmp.testing` module, user-supplied
callbacks in Scenario.solve(). The `retixmp` package using reticulate to access
the ixmp API is renamed to `rixmp` and now has its own unit tests (the former
`rixmp` package can be accessed as `rixmp.legacy`).

Release 0.2.0 coincides with MESSAGEix release 1.2.0.
