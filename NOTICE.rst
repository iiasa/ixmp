User guidelines and notice
==========================

The :doc:`user guidelines and notice for MESSAGEix <message_ix:notice>` also apply to ixmp in their entirety.
We ask that you read the notice and take the actions whenever you:

- **use** the |ixmp|, or any model(s) you have built using this tool
- to **produce** any scientific publication, technical report, website, or other **publicly-available material**.

The guidelines include the *optional* step to cite the code via Zenodo (in addition to the *required* step to cite the peer-reviewed publication).
You must decide which records to cite:

- If you are using both :mod:`message_ix` *and* :mod:`ixmp`, then cite the MESSAGEix records.
- If you are using *only* :mod:`ixmp` *without* :mod:`message_ix`, then cite the ixmp records.
  ixmp has its own Zenodo records that are distinct from message_ix:

  - The DOI `10.5281/zenodo.4005665 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4005665>`_ represents *all* versions of the :mod:`ixmp` code, and will always resolve to the latest version.
  - At that page, you can also choose a different DOI in order to cite one specific version; for instance, `10.5281/zenodo.4005666 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4005666>`_ to cite v3.1.0.
