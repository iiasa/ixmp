## Overview

The ix modeling platform (ixmp) is a data warehouse for high-powered scenario
analysis, with interfaces to Python and R for efficient scientific workflows and
effective data pre- and post-processing, and a structured database backend for
version-controlled data management.

This repository contains the core and application programming interfaces (API)
for the ix modeling platform (ixmp), as well as a number of tutorials and
examples for a generic model instance based on Dantzig's transport problem.

## Getting started

### Documentation

Documentation of ixmp and the MESSAGEix framework is available in two forms:

- The [MESSAGEix framework documentation](https://message.iiasa.ac.at/)
  includes documentation of the
  [ixmp Python API](http://message.iiasa.ac.at/en/stable/api/ixmp.html), which
  is extended by the framework.
- The [stand-alone ixmp
  documentation](https://message.iiasa.ac.at/projects/ixmp/) contains
  additional information on installing ixmp from source, the R API, etc.

The online documentation is built automatically from the contents of the
[ixmp Github repository](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp).

For offline use, the documentation can be built from the source code.
See [`doc/README.rst`](doc/README.rst) for further details.


### Installation

Most users will have ixmp installed automatically as a dependency when
[installing MESSAGEix](https://message.iiasa.ac.at/en/stable/getting_started.html).

To install the ixmp R API, or to install ixmp from source code, see
[‘Installation’ in the documentation](https://message.iiasa.ac.at/projects/ixmp/en/stable/install.html).


### Tutorials

Introductory tutorials are provided in both Python and R.
See [‘Tutorials’ in the documentation](https://message.iiasa.ac.at/projects/ixmp/en/stable/tutorials.html) or [`tutorial/README.rst`](tutorial/README.rst).
